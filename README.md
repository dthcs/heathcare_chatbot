# Healthcare Chatbot Demo

Welcome to the Healthcare Chatbot Demo project! This project showcases the integration of machine learning models and AI-powered natural language processing to analyze healthcare data and provide insights and recommendations.

## Overview

The Healthcare Demo project utilizes Flask, a Python web framework, to create a web application interface for users to upload healthcare data files. The uploaded data is then processed using machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing PyTorch and the EfficientNet model architecture for classification tasks.

## Features

- **Data Upload:** Users can upload healthcare data files in CSV format through the web interface.
- **Data Processing:** Uploaded data is processed using PyTorch to make predictions based on the trained machine learning model.
- **AI Recommendations:** The application leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model to provide personalized recommendations based on the processed data and predictions.

## Getting Started

To run the Healthcare Demo project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the necessary environment variables, including `OPENAI_API_KEY`, by creating a `.env` file.
3. Run the Flask application using the provided `app.py` script: python app.py
4. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost`.
